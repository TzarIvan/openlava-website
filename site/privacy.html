        transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of
        your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
        Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create
        information from, your information may be used by openlava in the
        United States or any other country where openlava operates.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy,
        please contact us at privacy@openlava.com.</p>

      <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

      <p>We collect and use your information to provide our Services
        and improve them over time.</p>

      <p>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or
        reconfigure a openlava account, you provide some personal
        information, such as your name, username, password, and email
        address. Some of this information, for example, your name and
        username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your
        profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search,
        public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require
        registration.</p>

      <p>Additional Information: You may provide us with additional
        information to make public, such as a short biography, your location,
        or a picture. We may use your contact information to send you
        information
        about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from
        these messages by following the instructions contained within the
        messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may
        keep your message, email address and contact information to
        respond to
        your request. Providing the additional information described in this
        section is entirely optional.</p>

      <p>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data")
        created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include
        information such
        as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain,
        pages visited,
        and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with
        advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.</p>

      <p>Cookies: Like many websites, we may use "cookie" technology to
        collect
        additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but
        we do not
        require cookies for many parts of our Services. A cookie is a
        small data
        file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. openlava
        may use
        both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand
        how you
        interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our
        users and
        web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services.
        Most
        Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your
        browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to
        prompt
        you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

      <p>Third Party Services: openlava uses a variety of services hosted by
        third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our
        various
        blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services,
        such
        as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by
        your
        browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP
        request.</p>

      <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

      <p>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited
        circumstances described here.</p>

      <p>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your
        consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access
        your openlava account.</p>

      <p>Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to
        perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your
        personal information with these third parties, but only to the
        extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such
        services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the
        protections of this privacy policy.</p>

        that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,

        of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

      <h3>Modifying Your Personal Information</h3>

      <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with
        tools to access or modify the personal information you provided
        to us and associated with your account.</p>

      <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

      <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.

        of your information and will always be at
        http://openlava.org/privacy. If we make a change to this
        policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will
        notify you via an @openlava update or e-mail to the email
        associated with your account. By continuing to access or use
        the Services after those changes become effective, you agree
