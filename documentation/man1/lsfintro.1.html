     <H3>RESOURCE REQUIREMENT STRINGS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Many of the above commands and utilities permit a resource requirement
string to be specified.  A resource requirement string contains information
used for querying for information from the <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT> about hosts or
requesting task placement decisions.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
A resource requirement string is divided into four sections including
a selection section, an ordering section, a resource usage section and
a job spanning section. The
selection section specifies the criteria for selecting hosts from the system.
The ordering section indicates how the hosts which meet the selection criteria
should be sorted. The resource usage section specifies the expected resource
consumption of the task or the resource reservation for a batch job.
The job spanning section specifies whether to span a (parallel) batch job
across multiple hosts.
The syntax of a resource requirement expression is
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
<B> "select[ </B><I>selectstring</I><B> ] order[ </B><I>orderstring</I> ]
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
<B>rusage[ </B><I>usagestring</I><B> ] span[ </B><I>spanstring</I> ]"
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
where &#145;<B>select</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>order</B>&#146; , &#145;<B>rusage</B>&#146; and &#145;<B>span</B>&#146; are
the section names.
Any character in the resource requirement expression not within the above
sections are ignored.  If a section is repeated multiple times in a resource
requirement expression, then only the first occurrence is considered.
The syntax for each of &#145;<I>selectstring</I>&#146;, &#145;<I>orderstring</I>&#146;,
&#145;<I>usagestring</I>&#146; and &#145;<I>spanstring</I>&#146; is defined below. Depending on
the command, one or more of these sections may be ignored. For example,
<!-- .BR lshosts (1) -->
<B>lshosts</B>(1)
will only select hosts, but not order them,
<!-- .BR lsload (1) -->
<B>lsload</B>(1)
will select and order the hosts,
<!-- .BR lsplace (1) -->
<B>lsplace</B>(1)
uses the information in select, order and rusage sections to select an
appropriate host for a task.
<!-- .BR lsloadadj (1) -->
<B>lsloadadj</B>(1)
uses the resource usage section to determine how the load information
should be adjusted on a host, while
<!-- .BR bsub (1) -->
<B>bsub</B>(1)
uses all the four sections.
Sections other than these are ignored. If no section name is given, then
the string is treated as a &#145;<I>selectstring</I>&#146;. The &#145;<B>select</B>&#146;
keyword may be omitted if the &#145;<I>selectstring</I>&#146; appears as the first
string in the resource requirement.
<P>
<!-- .SS Selection String -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection String</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
The selection string specifies the characteristics a host must have to be returned.
It is a logical expression built from a set of resource names.
The resource names  and their descriptions can be obtained by running
the <FONT size=-1>openlava</FONT> utility program
<!-- .BR lsinfo (1). -->
<B>lsinfo</B>(1).
The resource names &#145;<B>swap</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>idle</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>login</B>&#146;, and
&#145;<B>cpu</B>&#146; are aliases for &#145;<B>swp</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>it</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>ls</B>&#146; and
&#145;<B>r1m</B>&#146; respectively which are returned by
<!-- .BR lsinfo (1). -->
<B>lsinfo</B>(1).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
Resource names correspond to information maintained by the <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT>
about hosts. Some resources correspond to dynamic information
about a host, such as its <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> queue length, available memory,
and available
swap space. These resources are referred to as load indices and can be
retrieved via
<!-- .BR lsload (1). -->
<B>lsload</B>(1).
Other resources correspond to static information about a host such as its
type, host model, relative <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> speed, total memory and total swap space.
This information can be retrieved via
<!-- .BR lshosts (1). -->
<B>lshosts</B>(1).
The system administrator can define other resources in the system
in addition to those built in to <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT>.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
An arbitrary expression with resource
names being combined with logical or mathematical operators, and functions
can be specified.
Valid operators include &#145;<B>&&</B>&#146; (logical AND), &#145;<B>||</B>&#146; (logical OR),
&#145;<B>!</B>&#146; (logical NOT), &#145;<B>+</B>&#146; (addition), &#145;<B>-</B>&#146; (subtraction),
&#145;<B>*</B>&#146;,(multiplication) and &#145;<B>/</B>&#146; (division).
The function, <B>defined</B>, can be used to determine the hosts which have
a particular resource defined. 
The selection expression is evaluated for each host; if the result
is non-zero, then that host is selected.
<P>
For example,
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
 <B>"select[ (swp&gt;50 && mem&gt;=10 && type==MIPS) || (swp&gt;35 && type==ALPHA) ]"</B>
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
 <B>"select[ ((2*r15s + 3*r1m + r15m)/6 &lt; 2.0) && <BLINK>\!</BLINK>fs && (cpuf &gt; 4.0) ]"</B>
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
 <B>"select[ defined(verilog_license) ]"</B>
<P>
are valid selection expressions. Resource names which are of the boolean
type (e.g. &#145;<B>fs</B>&#146; for a file server resource) have a value of
1 if they are defined for a host, and 0 otherwise. The default is to
select all configured hosts in the cluster.  For the string valued resources
&#145;<B>type</B>&#146; and &#145;<B>model</B>&#146;, special values of &#145;<B>any</B>&#146; and
&#145;<B>local</B>&#146; can be used to select any value or the same value as that of
the local host, respectively. For example, "<B>type==local</B>" would select
hosts of the same type as the local host.
When the run queue lengths &#145;<B>r15s</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>r1m</B>&#146;, or
&#145;<B>r15m</B>&#146; are specified, the effective value of the queue length is used.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
For tasks where an arbitrary selection string is not required a restricted
syntax is provided. The restricted syntax allows for combining resource
names using &#145;:&#146; (logical AND) and &#145;-&#146; (logical NOT).
For example,
"<B>r15m=1.5:mem=20:swp=12:-ultrix</B>"
is a valid selection string in the restricted syntax. It is equivalent
to "<B>r15m &lt;= 1.5 && mem &gt;= 20 && swp &gt;= 12 && !ultrix</B>" in the
unrestricted syntax.  A selection string in the restricted syntax is of
the form
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
"<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]:<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]: ... :<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]"
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
where each &#145;<I>res</I>&#146; is resource name. <I>value</I> may only be specified for
resources whose value type
is numeric or string. The semantics of &#145;=&#146; depends on the value type
and sorting order for the resource. For string resources &#145;=&#146;, is equivalent
to &#145;==&#146;. For numeric valued resources &#145;=&#146; is equivalent to &#145;&gt;=&#146;  (&#145;&lt;=&#146;)
if the sorting order for the resource is decreasing (increasing).
A &#145;-&#146; may only be used in front of a boolean resource name or in
isolation. In isolation &#145;-&#146; is equivalent to "<B>type==any</B>".
If the value is not given for a numeric resource then it is equivalent
to saying that the resource must have a non-zero value.
Other examples of a selection string in the restricted syntax are,
"<B>-:swp=12</B>", "<B>type=MIPS:maxmem=20</B>", and
"<B>status=busy</B>".
<P>
<!-- .SS Order String -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=4>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Order String</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
The order string allows the selected hosts to be sorted according to
the value(s) of resource(s). The syntax of the order string is
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
"[-]<I>res</I>:[-]<I>res</I>:...[-]<I>res</I>"
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
Each &#145;<I>res</I>&#146; is a resource name with
a numeric value type. Currently only load indices such as &#145;<B>mem</B>&#146;,
&#145;<B>swp</B>&#146;, and &#145;<B>tmp</B>&#146;  which are returned by
<!-- .BR lsload (1) -->
<B>lsload</B>(1)
are considered for sorting.
For example, "<B>swp:r1m:tmp:r15s</B>" is a valid order string.
The order string is used as input to a multi-level sorting algorithm,
where each sorting phase orders the hosts according to one particular
load index and discards some hosts. The remaining hosts are passed onto the
next phase. The first phase begins with the last index and proceeds from
right to left. The final phase of sorting orders the hosts according to
their status, with hosts that are currently not available for load sharing
(i.e., not in the <B>ok</B> state) listed at the end.
When sorting is done on the particular index, the direction in which the
hosts are sorted (increasing vs. decreasing values) is determined by the
default order returned by
<!-- .BR lsinfo (1) -->
<B>lsinfo</B>(1)
for that index. This direction is chosen such that after sorting, the
hosts are ordered from best to worst on that index.
A &#145;-&#146; before the index name reverses the order.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
If no sorting string is specified, the default sorting string is
"<B>r15s:pg</B>".
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
When the run queue lengths &#145;<B>r15s</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>r1m</B>&#146;, or &#145;<B>r15m</B>&#146; are
specified, the normalized value of the queue length is used when sorting.
<P>
<!-- .SS Resource Usage String -->
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A name=5>

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Resource Usage String</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The resource usage section is used to specify the resource reservation
for batch jobs via <B>bsub -R</B>
option and queue configuration parameter
<!-- .BR RES_REQ. -->
<B>RES_REQ.</B> External indices are also considered in the resource
usage string for this purpose.
The syntax of the resource usage string is
<!-- .Lp -->
<BR>.Lp 
"<I>res</I>=<I>value</I>:<I>res</I>=<I>value</I>: ... :<I>res</I>=<I>value</I>[:<I>duration=</I><I>value</I>][:<I>decay</I>=<I>value</I>]"
<!-- .LP -->
<P>
The "<I>res</I>=<I>value</I>" is used to specify
the amount of resource to be reserved for a job after the job starts.
If <I>value</I> is not specified, the resource will not be reserved.
"<I>duration=value</I>" and "<I>decay=value</I>" are optionally used to specify
how long the resource reservation will be in effect and how the reserved
amount of resource is decreased as the time passes.  "<I>duration</I>" and
"<I>decay</I>" are keywords.
<P>
The value of "<I>duration</I>" (in minutes) is
the time period within which the specified resources will be reserved.
The value can be specified in hours if followed by "h", e.g.,
"<I>duration=2h</I>".  If "<I>duration</I>" is not given,
the default is to reserve the total amount for the lifetime of the job.
<P>
A value of 1 for "<I>decay</I>" indicates that the system should linearly
decrease the reserved amount over the duration.  A value of 0 causes
the total amount to be reserved for the entire duration or until the
job finishes.  All other values for "<I>decay</I>" are not supported.
The "<I>decay</I>" keyword is ignored if the duration is not specified.
The default value for "<I>decay</I>" is 0.
<P>
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
For example,
"<I>rusage[mem=50:duration=2.0:decay=1]</I>" will initially
reserve 50 MBytes of memory.  As the job runs, the
amount reserved amount will decrease
by 0.5 Mbytes each minute such that the reserved amount is 0 after
2.0 minutes.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The resource usage string is also used in adjusting the load
and for mapping tasks onto hosts during a placement decision (see
<!-- .BR lsplace (1) -->
<B>lsplace</B>(1)
and
<!-- .BR lsloadadj (1)). -->
<B>lsloadadj</B>(1)).
External indices are not considered in the resource
usage string for this purpose.
The syntax of the resource usage string is
"<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]:<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]: ... :<I>res</I>[=<I>value</I>]"
where &#145;<I>res</I>&#146; is one of the
resources whose value is returned by
<!-- .BR lsload (1). -->
<B>lsload</B>(1).
For example, "<B>r1m=0.5:mem=20:swp=40</B>" indicates that the task
is expected to increase the 1-minute run queue length by 0.5, consume
20 Mbytes of memory and 40 Mbytes of swap space.
If no value is specified, the
task is assumed to be intensive in using that resource. In this case
no more than one task will be assigned to a host regardless of how
many <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT>s it has.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The default resource usage for a task is assumed to be
"<B>r15s=2.0:r1m=2.0:r15m=2.0</B>" which indicates a <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> intensive task
which consumes few other resources.

    <H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Job Spanning String</H4>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This string specifies the locality of a parallel batch job.  Currently
only the following two cases are supported:  "<I>span[hosts=1]</I>"
indicates that all the processors allocated to this job must be on the
same host, while "<I>span[ptile=N]</I>" indicates that up <I>N</I> processor(s)
on each host should be allocated to the job.

<!-- .SH RUN QUEUE LENGTHS -->

<A name=7>

     <H3>RUN QUEUE LENGTHS</H3>

</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The raw <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> queue length is collected by the <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT> from the kernel of the
host operating system every 5 seconds. This number represents the total number
of processes that are contending for the <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT>(s) on the host.
The raw queue
length is averaged over 15 seconds, 1 minute, and 15 minutes to produce the
&#145;<B>r15s</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>r1m</B>&#146;, and &#145;<B>r15m</B>&#146; load indices, respectively. The raw
queue lengths can be viewed using
<!-- .BR lsload (1). -->
<B>lsload</B>(1).
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
In order to compare queue
lengths on hosts having different numbers of <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT>s and
relative <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> speeds, two variations of the raw queue length are defined.
The effective queue length attempts to account for multiprocessor hosts
by considering the number of <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT>s.
The effective queue length is calculated by taking the multiprocessor&#146;s
multitasking feature into consideration such that even if many of the
processors are busy, the host&#146;s effective queue length may appear to be as
good as an idle uniprocessor (as long as there is one or more idle processors).
The effective queue length is the same as the raw queue length on
uniprocessor hosts. Effective queue lengths are listed when using
the <B>-E</B> option of
<!-- .B lsload. -->
<B>lsload.</B> The effective queue length is used by <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT> when testing whether the host has
exceeded its busy thresholds. When &#145;<B>r15s</B>&#146;, &#145;<B>r1m</B>&#146;, or &#145;<B>r15m</B>&#146;
are specified in the selection section of resource requirement strings,
they refer to the effective queue length. It is also used by
<!-- .BR lsfbatch (1) -->
<B>lsfbatch</B>(1)
when comparing the values specified for queue and host thresholds against
the current load.
<!-- .PP -->
<P>
The normalized queue length
is used by the <FONT size=-1>LIM</FONT> when making placement decision about where to send
a job
(see
<!-- .BR lsplace (1)).  -->
<B>lsplace</B>(1)).
It considers both the number of <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT>s and the <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> factor of a host.
This is also the value returned by
<!-- .B lsload  -->
<B>lsload</B> when using the <B>-N</B> option.
The normalized queue length attempts to estimate
what the load would be on a host if an additional <FONT size=-1>CPU</FONT> bound job was dispatched
to that host.
