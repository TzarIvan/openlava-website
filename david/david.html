<h2 class="chapter">About me</h2>

Over 15 years of experience in Unix system development, clustering
and system administration. I have deep knowledge in the analysis of
distributed and implementation of (client/server) system, communication
protocols and system performance analysis of complex systems.
Whenever possible I work on the entire product cycle from design,
to implementation, testing, delivery and support. I have extensive
experience in integrating diverse technologies to provide end
solutions for clients. I am Geology graduate from the University of Rome
'La Sapienza' with thesis in theoretical seismology and I am a member
of the Applied  Mathematics Research Group of the University of Rome

<p>
I provide custom development, support and consulting for Unix/Linux
system level software development projects.
If you're interested in pursuing a project with me please contact me at
<a href="mailto:davidbigagli.com">david@davidbigagli.com.</a>

<h2 class="chapter">HPC development</h2>

<p>
While others have been endlessly discussing standards for grid computing
I have been delivering the real benefits of it for a many years utilizing
available tools, technologies and developing new ones.
I have helped to solve some of the worlds
most complex compute intensive problems by getting the right resources to
the right users at the right time. In the HPC developmet I specialize in
the following three main fields:

<ul>
<li>Job scheduling Algorithm<br>
<li>Resource management algorithms<br>
<li>Job dispatching, resource allocation and message passign algorithms.
</ul>

</p>

<h2 class="LSF">Development activities</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<h3 class="openlava">Openlava development</h3>

In 2011 I initiated the development of
<a href="http://www.openlava.org">www.openlava.org</a> opensource
distributed workload managemet system, I am the chief architect
and developer of the openlava scheduling kernel and system protocols,
and I act as the project's coordinator. The purpose of openlava is to
provide the market with a open source version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF">Platform LSF&#8482;</a>
and increase its world wide adoption as workload management tool.

<li>
<h3 class="pyx">PYX high performance multiprotocol software switch</h3>
This project involves routing data between a user laptop and
corporate server over a cryptography network. PYX is a fast data relay
which makes possible to do secure online real time presentation across WAN.
A worldwide cluster of PYX switches allows users to access the secure
network from anywhere in the world wide wan. Pyx is at the core of
<a href="http://www.route1.com">MobiNET&#8482;</a>

<li>
<h3 class="smart">Project SMART</h3>
Collecting data from a larger number, of user hard drives, being it a
home system or a corporate network to build a large statistical database
of<em>S.M.A.R.T.</em> data to anticipate the failure of a given hard
drive and backup its data.

<li>
<h3 class="mc">External LSF plugins for large data set management</h3>

In this activity I develop custom plugins for the LSF scheduler that
allow jobs to be dispatched based on network and file system status.
Jobs can be also scheduled to where the data are available by using
so called <em>data attractors</em>.

What follows is an example of problems the team I worked with
 was involved in and which we were able to successfully resolved
to customer satisfaction.

</ul>

<h2 class="LSF">Past LSF&#8482 development</h2>

I worked for 15 years as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF">Platform LSF&#8482;</a>
developer, support and consulting engineer. I used to gather first hand
requirements from customers, then implement the feature, installed it
and support it. Still today I have good relationship with major
LSF customers and I can provide references on request. My work helped
the Company to increase and consolidate the revenue stream from their
products. <p>

<p> The following is list of some of the project I developed
as designer and developer.

<ul>
<li>
Optimum deadline based scheduling for jobs
<li>
Larger cluster scalability optimization
<li>
Multicluster congestion control protocol
<li>
Multicluster parallel jobs distribution algorithm
<li>
Probabilistic optimization of fairshare algorithm
<li>
License allocation scheduler
<li>
Resource allocation scheduler to multiple application manager in large clusters.
<li>
Virtual machines scheduler driven by VM requirements and application
requirements.

</ul>


<h2 class="Patents">US patents</h2>

<ul class="patent">

<li>Goal-oriented predictive scheduling in a grid environment.
